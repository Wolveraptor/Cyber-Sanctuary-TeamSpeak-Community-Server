#### Cyber Sanctuary | Categories and Channels | Format and Example
* Below is an explanation of how categories and channels are documented within this README.md.
    * Format:
        * <VSN: Virtual Server Name>
        * <S: Spacer Name>
            * <CB: Channel Banner>
        * <C: Channel Name>
            * <CT: Channel Topic>
            * <CD: Channel Description>
            * <CB: Channel Banner>
            * <SC: Sub-Channel Name>
                * <CB: Channel Banner>
    * Example:
        * VSN: `Example Virtual Server` (`Virtual Server` with name `Example Virtual Server`.)
        * S: `[cspacer0]Example Spacer` (`Spacer` with the text `Example Spacer` centered.)
        * C: `Channel` (`Voice and text channel` with the name `Channel`.)
            * SC: `Sub-Channel` (`Voice and text channel` with the name `Sub-Channel`.)
* Some spacers and channels use special `unicode` characters. The characters used can be found below.
    * A website that can be used to identify characters can be found here: https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/
    * Unicode Character `・` (`U+30FB`)
        * Name:	Katakana Middle Dot
    * Unicode Character `╮` (`U+256E`)
        * Name:	Box Drawings Light Arc Down and Left
    * Unicode Character `╯` (`U+256F`)
        * Name:	Box Drawings Light Arc Up and Left
    * Unicode Character `╭` (`U+256D`)
        * Name:	Box Drawings Light Arc Down and Right
    * Unicode Character `╰` (`U+2570`)
        * Name:	Box Drawings Light Arc Up and Right
* TeamSpeak leverages `Spacers` to separate channels. Below, is the `syntax` for TeamSpeak server `Spacers`.
    * Syntax: `[?spacer#]Text`
        * Where `?` stands for an alignment (`r`=`right`, `c`=`center`, `l`=`left`).
        * Where `*` will repeat the text to fill the whole line.
        * Change `#` to get a unique channel name.
        * Use one of the three-character-blocks as text for a special space: `---`, `...`, `-.-`, `___`, and `-..`.
        * Example:
            ```
            [lspacer0] a left aligned text
                                [cspacer1] a acentered text
                                                    [rspacer2] a right aligned text
            ```
